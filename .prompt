I am writing software that interfaces with the Acme text editor. The
code is largely Go and interface code in bash or sh.

I am an expert programmer but work with Junior developers every day.

I prefer:

* Code that reads as English
* More functions than deeper nesting
* Functions should have a single responsibility, where possible
* Readable code to concise magic
* Documentation on API functions
* Self documenting code over comments
* Comments when the code is complex and needs explanation
* Longer identifier names vs abbreviations. Only abbreviations
  when very well known
